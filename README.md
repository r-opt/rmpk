# MIP Modelling in R

<!-- badges: start -->

`rmpk` is a lightweight package to model mixed integer linear programs.
It is based on the API of the
[ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) package and is also
inspired by the architecture of [Julia
JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl).

The goal is to provide a modelling package that can both be used in
packages and also in interactive analyses. It also has a different
architecture as the modelling layer modifies a central solver. That
solver could be an interface to
[ROI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROI) or a shared pointer to a
specific solver. Thus giving the option to directly communicate with the
solver while still using an algebraic modelling framework.

This is currently work in progress and experimental - but working. I
might merge it with [ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) but
it could also become the successor of
[ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) ‚Ä¶ not sure yet.

If you want to see the package in action take a look at the
[articles](https://r-opt.github.io/rmpk/) in the docs.

Happy to receive feedback!

*Still under development. Anything can change*

## Installation

You can install the released version of RMPK from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("r-opt/rmpk")
```

## Supported types

-   Linear Programming (LP)
-   Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
-   Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP)
-   Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP)

## Features

-   ‚úÖ Algebraic modelling of mixed integer programming problems

-   ‚úÖ Integer, binary and continious variables

-   ‚úÖ Linear and quadratic constraints/objective

-   ‚úÖ Bindings to most popular solvers through
    [ROI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROI)

-   ‚úÖ Support for character variable indexes

-   ‚úÖ Access row/column duals of Linear Programs

-   ‚úÖ Row generation through solver callbacks (e.g.¬†for models with
    exponential many constraints)

-   üöß Variable and constraint names

-   üöß Initial feasible solutions

-   üöß Almost as fast as matrix code

## Low Level ROI Example

``` r
library(rmpk)
library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
set.seed(42)
solver <- ROI_optimizer("glpk")
v <- rnorm(10)
w <- rnorm(10)
model <- optimization_model(solver)
x <- model$add_variable("x", type = "binary", i = 1:10)
model$set_objective(sum_expr(v[i] * x[i], i = 1:10), sense = "max")
model$add_constraint(sum_expr(w[i] * x[i], i = 1:10) <= 10)
model$optimize()
model$get_variable_value(x[i])
#>    name  i value
#> 1     x  1     1
#> 2     x  7     1
#> 3     x  5     1
#> 4     x  8     0
#> 5     x  2     0
#> 6     x 10     0
#> 7     x  9     1
#> 8     x  3     1
#> 9     x  6     0
#> 10    x  4     1
```

## Contribute

The best way at the moment to contribute is to test the package, write
documentation, propose features. Soon, code contributions are welcome as
well.
