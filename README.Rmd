`rmpk` is a lightweight package to model mixed integer linear programs. It is based on the API of the [ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) package and is also inspired by the architecture of [Julia JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl).

The goal is to provide a modelling package that can both be used in packages and also in interactive analyses. It also has a different architecture as the modelling layer modifies a central solver. That solver could be an interface to [ROI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROI) or a shared pointer to a specific solver. Thus giving the option to directly communicate with the solver while still using an algebraic modelling framework.

This is currently work in progress and experimental - but working. I might merge it with [ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) but it could also become the successor of [ompr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/ompr) ... not sure yet.

If you want to see the package in action take a look at the [articles](https://r-opt.github.io/rmpk/) in the docs.

Happy to receive feedback!

_Still under development. Anything can change_

## Installation

You can install the released version of RMPK from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("r-opt/rmpk")
```

## Supported types

* Linear Programming (LP)
* Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
* Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP)
* Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP)

## Features

* âœ… Algebraic modelling of mixed integer programming problems
* âœ… Integer, binary and continious variables
* âœ… Linear and quadratic constraints/objective
* âœ… Bindings to most popular solvers through [ROI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ROI)
* âœ… Support for character variable indexes
* âœ… Access row/column duals of Linear Programs
* âœ… Row generation through solver callbacks (e.g. for models with exponential many constraints)

* ðŸš§ Variable and constraint names
* ðŸš§ Initial feasible solutions
* ðŸš§ Almost as fast as matrix code
* ...

## Low Level ROI Example

```{r}
library(rmpk)
library(ROI.plugin.glpk)
set.seed(42)
solver <- ROI_optimizer("glpk")
v <- rnorm(10)
w <- rnorm(10)
model <- optimization_model(solver)
x <- model$add_variable("x", type = "binary", i = 1:10)
model$set_objective(sum_expr(v[i] * x[i], i = 1:10), sense = "max")
model$add_constraint(sum_expr(w[i] * x[i], i = 1:10) <= 10)
model$optimize()
model$get_variable_value(x[i])
```

## List of solvers

`rmpk` supports all solvers that implement the [`MOI` interface](https://github.com/r-opt/MOI). It also comes
with a `ROI_optimzer` that internally uses [`ROI`](https://roi.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html) and thus gives [access to most
popular solvers](https://roi.r-forge.r-project.org) out of the box.
Note that `ROI` has its own plugin system and you need to install these solvers
separately in addition to [`ROIoptimizer`](https://github.com/r-opt/ROIoptimizer).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
roi_solvers <- ROI::ROI_available_solvers()$Package
roi_solvers <- unique(substr(roi_solvers, 12, nchar(roi_solvers)))
df <- data.frame(
  solver_name = c(roi_solvers, "glpk"),
  r_package = c(rep.int("ROIoptimizer", length(roi_solvers)), "GLPKoptimizer"),
  url = c(rep.int("https://github.com/r-opt/ROIoptimizer", length(roi_solvers)), "https://github.com/r-opt/GLPKoptimizer"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(df[order(df$solver_name), ],
  col.names = c("Solver Name", "R Package", "Github URL"),
  row.names = FALSE
)
```


## Contribute

The best way at the moment to contribute is to test the package, write documentation, propose features. Soon, code contributions are welcome as well.
